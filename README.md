Tableau Lab 3 file is a story created using my tableau skills to explore the solar systems dataset sourced from Kaggle.
This has some of the best and beautiful visuals that describe teh intricate properties of the planets of our Solar System.
The visuals are self explanatory with adequate texts provided against them to explain the concpts thorougly.

The second file which is Lab 2 is my analysis on the Disney Movie reviews Dataset from Kaggle.My Analysis focussed on extracting key-words from the 
review text and analyze the impact of the key-words on the overall sentiment and rating by the reviewers.The interesting part of this analysis is that 
the whole of sentiment analysis is carried out on Tableau.
